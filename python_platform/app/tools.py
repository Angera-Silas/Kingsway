"""Governed tool execution: Python agents never touch school data directly.

Every tool request is relayed to the PHP edge (POST /api/dashboard/agent-tool),
which re-authorizes the recorded operator against the tool's workflow and
executes it through the existing governed services (NLQ reports, deterministic
intelligence brief, workflow catalogue). This keeps ALL authorization,
row-level scope and audit inside PHP while ALL agent logic runs in Python.

System-administrator tools (system.*) are executed locally and are guarded
behind the ``system_admin`` permission. They read allowlisted repo and log
files so an administrator can diagnose the platform without a model ever
touching school data directly.

Web tools (web.*) are also executed locally: a Kenyan CBC school needs current
world information (KICD/KNEC/Ministry guidance, teaching resources) that the
school database cannot hold. They are outbound, so they are bounded hard and
journalled; they never carry school data because the only input is the
operator's own question.
